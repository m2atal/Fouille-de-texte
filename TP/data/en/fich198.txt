The United states and Japan are not involved in a trade war,
despite U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttera said
"In my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war,"
Yetter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.
Yeuttere said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement with
the U.S. on semiconductor trade, "then the retaliatory response
will fast a relatively short period."
Yetter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third countries
and buy more American computer chips.
